# Sayings of Richard Stallman


* Please do not mention non-free GNU/Linux distros (for instance, Ubuntu) in the publicity for the event.
* **I do NOT use** browsers, I use the SSH protocol. If the network requires a proxy for SSH, I probably can't use it at all.
* **Please don't be surprised if I pull out my** computer at dinner and begin handling some of my email.
* **Please do not ask me any questions about** what I will do for breakfast. Please just do not bring it up.
* **Please do not ever mail me a file larger than** 100k without asking me first. 
* **DON'T buy a** parrot figuring that it will be a fun surprise for me. To
acquire a parrot is a major decision: it is likely to outlive you. If
you don't know how to treat the parrot, it could be emotionally
scarred and spend many decades feeling frightened and unhappy. If you
buy a captured wild parrot, you will promote a cruel and devastating
practice, and the parrot will be emotionally scarred before you get it.
Meeting that sad animal is not an agreeable surprise.
