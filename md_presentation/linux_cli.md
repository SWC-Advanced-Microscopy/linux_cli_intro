## SSH
* Logging onto machines with SSH. 
* Reaching your Linux PC from home without VPN.
* Setting up passwordless SSH using a shared key (Copy your SSH key (ssh-copy-id) There are multiple ways to achieve this however this command is a shortcut that saves time. What does it actually do? This command replicates what you can also do manually. Copying the ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (or the default) key from your system and adds it to an ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the remote server.

```
localhost:~$ ssh-copy-id user@remoteserver
```
