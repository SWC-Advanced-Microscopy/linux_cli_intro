# Presentation Plan

Presentation first page has links that people might want to copy down. 
So that should probably be up as people file in. 

To initially show people surprising things the CLI can do, you can try the following. 

* Have `cmatrix` running in the background whilst people take their seats. 
* Demo `curl wttr.in/London` you can `alias weather='curl wttr.in/London'`
* Demo `telnet mapscii.me` you can `alias maps='telnet mapscii.me'` (If it works... Telnet version may be broken)
* Point out these things are not necessarily useful, but they are cool and in that spirit the presentation will be done on the CLI
* The linux history presentation is optional and puts things into context: GNU, Linux, distros, etc
* Then main presentation
