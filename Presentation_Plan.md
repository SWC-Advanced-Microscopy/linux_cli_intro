# Presentation Plan

To initially show people surprising things the CLI can do, you can try the following. 

* Have `cmatrix` running in the background whilst people take their seats. 
* Demo `curl wttr.in/London` you can `alias weather='curl wttr.in/London'`
* Demo `telnet mapscii.me` you can `alias maps='telnet mapscii.me'` (If it works... Telnet version may be broken)
* Point out these things are not necessarily useful, but they are cool and in that spirit the presentation will be done on the CLI
