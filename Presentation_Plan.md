# Presentation Plan

## Running time
It takes about two hours to run through the history and cli presentations if you do not have any breaks. 
This is with attendees following along as they wish on their own PCs. 
If you run some thing as a group exercise (e.g. SSH keys or tmux/Python) then it might take longer. 

## To do in advance
Make sure attendees have a functioning command line and have installed the right tools in advance. 
See main README.
If you are expecting the to connect to a server remotely, such a bastion, with their own credentials then ensure they can all do this in advance. 
Otherwise some people can get confused with passwords or usernames and end up locked out of the server for a period.

## Presentation Order
Have the history presentation running and be on the first page. 
This allows people to jot down the links if you didn't already send them. 

Then it's a nice idea to show some clever command line tools to hook people:

* Run `cmatrix` running in the background whilst people take their seats. 
* Demo `curl wttr.in/London` you can `alias weather='curl wttr.in/London'`
* Demo `telnet mapscii.me` you can `alias maps='telnet mapscii.me'` (If it works... Telnet version may be broken)
* `neofetch`
* Point out these things are not necessarily useful, but they are cool and in that spirit the presentation will be done on the CLI


Now run the main presentation
